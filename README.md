## Behind the scenes
The app is developed on [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch) and can be compiled using [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/).

If you have never used Sencha Touch before, the [Getting Started with Sencha 2](http://www.sencha.com/learn/getting-started-with-sencha-touch-2) tutorial is a great and easy starting point.

The easiest way to compile the codebase into an installable package for your mobile device is using [Phonegap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) from Adobe.

Just create a free account and use this (or your forked) Git repository to build your own compiled app in seconds. Phonegap Build is also available as part of the [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html).
